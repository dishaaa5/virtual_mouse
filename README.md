# 🖱️ Virtual Mouse using Hand Gestures

This project implements a **Virtual Mouse** that allows users to control the system mouse using **hand gestures** captured through a webcam.  
It uses **Computer Vision** techniques with **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **PyAutoGUI** to track hand landmarks in real time.
